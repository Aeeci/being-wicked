					<p>We are a small, smart, experienced team who are out to create excellent online projects, whether they be websites, applications or games. We've been designing and developing such things for over a decade now; we're pretty good at it!

					<h3>the team</h3>
					<p>Lorissa Shepstone, Creative Founder
                    Lorissa started her design career in the late 90's and is a keen advocate of elegant, clean design and web standards. When she's not working on a design project, she can be found with her camera exploring her other love: photography. She's easily bribed with soya cappuccinos and chocolate. Just saying.</p>

					<div id="r2right">
					<h4>for the love of books</h4>
					<p>We're a bunch of bookworms. We love books and we've been fortunate to work with numerous authors and publishers in creating great websites, applications and games. We are well-versed in best practices for the publishing arena, and in working with authors and publishers to meet expectations (not to mention those book launch deadlines!). It's exciting to launch a new book and we love being a part of that. If you are an author or publisher who isn't already working with us, you should hire us. We know what we are doing and we love our work. A great combination when you want someone to put every effort into getting your book seen.</p>

						<p>Gordon Clemmons, Codemonger<br>
						Since the age of 9, Gordon has had a passion for programming. His passion for games probably arrived around the same time. He believes in using the right tools for the job and, through experience, knows the pros and cons of many.</p>

					<div id="r3right">
						<p>What we take seriously..</p>
					
						<ul>	
							<li> Effective, clean, and beautiful design. </li>
							<li> Web standards and Web accessibility. </li>
							<li> Honest, long-term client relationships.  We've been working with some of our clients for years, and they are more friends than clients at this point.</li>
