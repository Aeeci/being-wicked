					<p>We love books, whether they be science or science-fiction, memoirs or mysteries. There's something magical about sitting down with a fresh book, so full of potential and wonder. And there's equal magic in the sorrow of saying goodbye to characters you've grown to know and love as you turn that last page.

					<br>Words are powerful.</p>

				<div id="r3right">
					<p>Now you need those words to be read and shared. We're good at that. In fact, it's what we're best at: we're a design and development studio that specializes in the publishing industry. So, if you're a writer or a publisher that we're not already working with, you should hire us. We're wicked good.
